    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Get the taste of Ireland with this fresh, no-fuss soda bread</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g plain white flour</li>
        <li>250g plain wholemeal flour</li>
        <li>100g porridge oats</li>
        <li>1tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>1tsp salt</li>
        <li>25g butter, cut in pieces</li>
        <li>500ml buttermilk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas 6/fan 180C and dust a baking sheet with flour. Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl, then rub in the butter. Pour in the buttermilk and mix it in quickly with a table knife, then bring the dough together very lightly with your fingertips (handle it very, very gently). Now shape it into a flat, round loaf measuring 20cm/8in in diameter.</li>
            <li>Put the loaf on the baking sheet and score a deep cross in the top. (Traditionally, this lets the fairies out, but it also helps the bread to cook through.) Bake for 30-35 minutes until the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. If it isn’t ready after this time, turn it upside down on the baking sheet and bake for a few minutes more.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a wire rack, cover with a clean tea towel (this keeps the crust nice and soft) and leave to cool. To serve, break into quarters, then break or cut each quarter in half to make 8 wedges or slices – or simply slice across. Eat very fresh.</li>
    
        </ol>
